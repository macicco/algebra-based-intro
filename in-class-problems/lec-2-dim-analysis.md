# Problem

A mass on a spring oscillates back and forth (or up and down) with a frequency, $\omega$, that is related to some of the properties of the system. The units of frequency are 1/sec. Some of those properties are the mass of the object (usually in units of kg in this class), something called the spring constant, $k$, whose units are $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{sec}^2$ and the length of the spring when it is not stretched, $x_0$ (usually in meters).

Three students working on part of a building that is designed to oscillate (this is useful in places where earthquakes happen) can't remember the formula for frequency and come up with three possibilities:

*Student 1:* I think the formula for it is $\omega = k/m$. It looks familiar, anyway.

*Student 2:* I think you left out the length. That must matter too, and I think the formula is $\omega = k x_0/m$, because that uses all of the properties of the spring.

*Student 3:* Based on the units I think the frequency must be $\omega  \sqrt(k/m)$.

Which student, if any *could* be correct? For each student explain *why* you think she is correct or incorrect.
