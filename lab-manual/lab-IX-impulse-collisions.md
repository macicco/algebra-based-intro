- Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 8"**
 

## Basic Lab (B-level)

Let a cart traveling on slightly inclined track hit a ball placed in front of a force probe mounted at the bottom of the track. Remove the hook on the force probe so there is a flat interaction area. Increase the data collection rate (200 pts/sec is better than 20 pts/sec) and make sure you are not exceeding the force probe range (gentle collision). There are brackets available if you want to try different arrangements.

- Record the force and motion of the cart when it collides with an elastic object (happy ball) and an inelastic object (unhappy ball).
    - Calculate the impulse from the force vs time graph
    - Calculate the change in momentum 
    - Compare for different inclines and/or speeds (how many should you have for a "good" comparison?)

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level)

- Determine the momentum and energy (read ahead!) before and after elastic and inelastic collisions. The carts have Velcro that can be used to stick them together. You can use two motion detectors but make sure they don't "see" each other and have cross talk confuse the position vs time data. 
    - Two cars of equal mass collide. 
    - A massive car colliding with a smaller car.
    - A smaller car colliding with a massive car 
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first).
