- Agreement in measurements based on uncertainty

Physics Concepts

- Vector components, addition and subtraction
- Equations of motion for constant acceleration
- Understand the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration
- Interpret plots of position, velocity, and acceleration for a variety of motions

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

**Useful resources: Simulations**

- Check your understanding by trying to hit a target with a projectile fired at different angles. [http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/projectile-motion](http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/projectile-motion)

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 3"**


## Basic Lab (B-level)

Using LoggerPro, analyze the motion of an object (insert movie "basketball shot"). 

- Produce graphs of the position, velocity and acceleration as a function of time in both the horizontal and vertical directions. 

- Find the horizontal velocity from position vs time graphs and compare to average velocity.
- Find the vertical acceleration from velocity vs time graphs and compare to average acceleration.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

- Graph the acceleration as a function of mass for a cart traveling down an incline. HINT: You will want to have at least 5 data points on a single plot.
- Pick another variable and determine how it affects an object's velocity, acceleration or position
- Use the "integration" feature to find the area under curve in some region of your acceleration plot. 
    - What are the units of this area? Explain why the area has these units.
    - What property of the velocity plot should the area match up with? Compare these two values, and do this for at least 5 regions!

- Use the "integration" feature to find the area under curve in some region of your velocity plot. 
    - What are the units of this area? Explain why the area has these units.
    - What property of the position plot should the area match up with? Compare these two values, and do this for at least 5 regions!

- Experimentally determine how a ball's horizontal and vertical velocities change after a bounce (use the video!)
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first)
