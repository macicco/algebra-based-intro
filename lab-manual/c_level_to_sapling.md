# Lab 4 - bracees/force as vector

Source of braces image: http://www.gcdental.com.au/lingual_braces.htm

potentially better pic, need to ask abt permissions: http://centralalbertaortho.me/products/lingual-braces/

For your convenience, and because this set of questions will require more pencil and paper work than previous questions, the situation you will be answering questions about is shown below:

In the picture below, the braces have been tightened so that they exert a net force of 1.2 N due south on the tooth circled. The neighboring teeth exert a total force of 0.5 N at 30$^\circ$ west of north. You want to develop a general formula (no numbers!) for the force the gum exerts on the tooth.

# Lab 5 - Force n Motion

- Draw a picture of a cart traveling down an inclined track.
- Draw a schematic diagram labeling the forces on the cart
- Draw a picture of a cart traveling along a flat track being pulled by a string (force)
- Draw a schematic diagram labeling the forces on the cart
Explorations:

- Imagine you are on a cart being pulled. You have hold of one end of the rope and your friend (the puller) is holding the other end of the rope.
    - You are stationary (you have your feet down). Is the force you exert on the rope greater than, less than or equal to your friend's force?
    - You are moving (you lifted your feet off the ground). Is the for

# Lab 6 -- Drag Force

You and a friend are tossing an object back and forth.

- Draw a schematic diagram with the forces labeled 
    - right after the object is thrown
    - when the object is at the top of it trajectory
    - right before the object is caught

Drop a (new) coffee filter and another that is wadded into a tight ball.

- Draw the velocity vs time graph for both coffee filters.
- Describe in words and pictures the terminal velocity of the coffee filter.


# Lab 7 -- Work and Energy

Draw a picture of a cart that is given a brief push so it travels up and then down an inclined track.

- Draw a schematic diagram with the forces labeled during and after the push
- Sketch plots of the kinetic, gravitational potential, and total energies of the cart as functions of time for the time period after the push.
- Find an equation for the change in gravitational energy as a function of the distance the cart has traveled along the track. HINT: first find the height of the car as a function of the distance it has moved along the track.

# Lab 8 -- Impulse

Suppose you wish to produce the greatest force on an object. You can throw either a bouncy ball or a non-bouncy (clay) ball. Each ball has the same mass, would interact with the object for the same amount of time, and you can throw them with the same speed.

- Using ideas of impulse and momentum, mathematically prove which ball produces the greatest force on the object (no plugging in numbers!).

Newton's Cradle is a toy you might have seen. It is a wooden rectangular box frame with multiple steel balls suspended next to each other in the middle such that they are free to swing horizontally.

![Newton's cradle](newtons-cradle.png)

- Suppose you have 5 steel balls suspended in the middle. If you pick 3 balls up and release them, what will happen? Why?

# Lab 9 - bone scaling

- Imagine that every dimension (length, width, and height) of an animal is doubled. How much would the force on one of the animal's legs (while standing at rest) increase by? HINT: Think of how the mass relates to the volume.
- If the bones scaled in the same way (length, width, and height are doubled), how much does the cross-sectional area of the bone increase by?
- Using your two previous answers, find how much the stress on the bone increases by when all of the dimensions of the animal are doubled
    - What if the animal's size is scaled up by 100 (such as from a mouse to an elephant)?
    - Why is this type of scaling problematic?

# Lab 10 -- Springs and Things

You are given two identical springs (with spring constant k) and a mass (m).

- Imagine that both springs are attached to the mass side-by-side ("in parallel"), and the springs are attached to the ceiling with the mass hanging from them.
    - Draw a schematic diagram of the forces acting on the mass (don't forget labels!).
    - How much would each spring stretch? Write your answer as a number times how far the mass would stretch a single spring supporting its weight.
    - If you wanted to replace your two-spring combination with a single spring that stretched the same amount, how would the spring constant of your new spring compare with the spring constant of one of the original springs?
- Repeat the previous steps, but this time for the case where the springs are attached end-to-end ("in series") to the block and hung from the ceiling.


# Lab 11 - Crane Arm

A crane is equipped with many safety features, such as radar to locate the position of the hook and a sensor to monitor the tension in the support wire. The designers want to program the tension sensor to anticipate the tension given the load on the crane and the distance from the mast.

- Draw a force diagram for the simplified crane model. Discuss this in your report.
- Work out an equation for the tension in the supporting cable. Your resulting equation can only depend on the following variables: the amount of mass on the crane ($m$); the mass of the crane arm ($M$); the distance of the mass from the crane mast ($d$); the angle that the cable makes with the crane arm ($\theta$); the length of the crane arm ($L$).

# Lab 12 -- Sustainability

Humans need energy (we call it "food") to survive, and this energy has to come from somewhere. 

- Use an online calorie calculator (such as the one at http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html ) to estimate your daily caloric need and:
    - record this number in your lab notebook
    - convert the number to Joules (really Joules / day)

Let's assume we have a technologically advanced device that can convert, with 100% efficiency, solar energy into your caloric energy. Find how much area you need to absorb the solar energy by:

- Looking up the term "insolation" (it's NOT the stuff that keeps your house warm), and finding a typical insolation value for the United States.
- Use the insolation value you found, along with your daily Caloric requirements, to find the area (in square-meters) needed by our technologically advanced device to convert enough solar energy to keep you "fed". Record this number in your lab notebook.

In preparation for B-Level, look up (using a textbook / journal article / good internet source):

- A typical value for the efficiency of photosynthesis for converting sunlight into biomass
- The term "trophic level", and "the 10% rule", and describe them
