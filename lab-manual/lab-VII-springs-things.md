# Springs and Things

| The wonderful thing about Tiggers 
| Is Tiggers are wonderful things 
| Their tops are made out of rubber 
| Their bottoms are made out of springs 
| They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy 
| Fun, fun, fun, fun, FUN!

## Additional Equipment

- Various colored springs
- Mass hangers with masses

## Objective

Data collection

- Quantitative analysis of oscillating spring and mass 

Lab Skills

- Uncertainty propagation
- Measurement Precision
- Significant Figures
- Agreement in measurements based on uncertainty
- Determine the spring constant
- Determine oscillation period. 
- Show energy is conserved (advanced) 

Physics Concepts

- Hooke's law, spring constant and elastic potential energy

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 10"**
 

## Basic Lab (B-level)

Determine the spring constant of your spring using the following **three** different methods. You should end up with **three plots**

- Directly measure (such as with a ruler) the spring stretch as a function of applied force.
- Hang a mass from your spring and set the system oscillating. Use the force probe and motion detector to plot Force vs. Distance for the oscillating system.
- Plot x(t) for your oscillating spring-mass system. Find the period of oscillation and hence spring constant from a sinusoidal curve fit to the data. To relate the spring constant to the period of oscillation, you may want to look in the "Oscillations" chapter of your textbook.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level)

- Verify your C-level predictions about springs in parallel and series using your methods from B-level
- Experimentally determine how the period of the spring-mass system depends on the mass, and compare with the expected value.
- Experimentally determine how the period of the spring-mass system depends on the spring constant, and compare with the expected value.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first).
