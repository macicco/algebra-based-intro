# Drag Forces


## Additional Equipment

- Coffee filters and small masses
- Optional: Cart, friction pad, track and Force Probe

## Objective

Data collection

- Set up appropriate experiment to measure position of a falling object 

Lab Skills

- Graph position and velocity as a function of time.
- Determine terminal velocity from a line fit
- Determine the dependence of drag force on velocity

Physics Concepts

- Terminal velocity (also called terminal speed)
- Drag force

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 6"**
 

## Basic Lab (B-level)

**Note:** Be careful not to drop anything massive on a motion detector. You might be able to mount the detector on the ceiling.

- Setup the motion detector to collect the position of a coffee filter falling straight down. Determine the power dependence of the drag force to the velocity. So given $F_d = b v^n$ 
determine $n$. 
- Change the mass of the filter (without changing its surface area) and determine the drag force.
- Graph the drag force as a function of terminal velocity and determine the power dependence.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

- Create a function that fits the acceleration vs time graph using the correct drag force.
- Repeat your experiment for an object you expect has a different drag force dependence.
- Determine the static and kinetic coefficients of friction for an object on a surface
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first)
