## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

This week's lab is more of a "group modeling exercise" rather than a traditional lab. The focus is on estimation and modeling assumptions to arrive at a reasonable answer.

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 12"**
 

## Basic Lab (B-level)

In C-Level, you found the area necessary to harvest enough solar energy to "feed" you, assuming 100% of it could be converted to "food". Unfortunately, devices for converting solar energy into consumable energy (we call them "plants") are not nearly that efficient!

- Using the efficiency of photosynthesis you found in C-Level and the "10 % rule", find the new total area required to convert solar energy into plant energy into Caloric energy. 
- Our model so far assumes that we get to convert solar energy into plants year-round. Looking outside, this is not the case! Estimate how much more area you need to collect enough extra energy during the "growing season" to keep you fed year-round. Record this number in your lab notebook.

The next refinement to our model: we just assumed that you only eat plant-derived calories. We now need to modify this number to account for the meat/veggie split in your diet.

- Estimate the percentage of your calories that are animal-derived (meat, eggs, egg-based noodles, milk, fish) and the percentage that are plant-derived. These numbers should add to 1!
- Using these percentages, the ideas of "trophic levels" (the 10% rule), find the new area required to absorb enough solar energy to feed you!

Next Up – Go Big! We want to estimate the total population that the Earth can support using this model. Do this by:

- Averaging your areas with those of your group members to get a more representative value
- Finding (look it up!) the total amount of farmable land on the planet. This is sometimes called "arable" land, and you will likely have to convert the units to square meters.
- Use both your average and the total arable area to find the maximum number of people the Earth can support, and compare with the Earth's current population.

**Uncertainties** – Your estimate is most definitely an estimate, but that does not mean we can't estimate uncertainties. With your group, pick one aspect of the model (one of the assumptions) that you believe uncertainty will have the largest effect on your final number. Estimate the uncertainty, and change the assumption to the "smaller" end, and see how much your final area changes. What percent did your answer change by?

**Modeling** – While this exercise has very little of what most people associate with a "lab", it contains one of the most important pieces of the scientific process – quantitative modeling of a physical system. All new theories/models go through this process, and are then tested (much like your model in the Bone Lab). Humanity is currently carrying out one big experiment right now to test the validity of this model…..

## Advanced Lab (A-level)

- Identify at least 2 additional ways in which the model could be modified to be more accurate (and carry out estimations to arrive at a new number, along with uncertainties)
- List all assumptions that went into the final model, and identify any assumptions that may be inaccurate, either now or at some point in the future, and discuss the implications. It may help to consider the question we were answering: "What is the total global population sustainable by the Earth?" NOTE: Some of the assumptions were not explicitly listed in the lab!
