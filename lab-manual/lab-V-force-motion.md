- Relationship between force and motion (Newton's Second Law)

## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 5"**
 

**Explorations (part in lab, part in Sapling):**

- Imagine you are on a cart being pulled. You have hold of one end of the rope and your friend (the puller) is holding the other end of the rope.
    - You are stationary (you have your feet down). Is the force you exert on the rope greater than, less than or equal to your friend's force?
    - You are moving (you lifted your feet off the ground). Is the force you exert on the rope greater than, less than or equal to your friend's force?
    - **(Do DURING Lab)** Set up and calibrate the force sensors to check your answers.

## Basic Lab (B-level)

Attach a force probe to a cart on a flat track and connect a string to the force probe. Pass the string over a pulley on the end of the track and connect it to a mass hanger. The falling mass will pull the cart down the track.

- You will determine how force affects motion by varying the mass that is pulling the cart. Eventually, you want to create a single plot which shows cart acceleration as a function of pulling force.
    - What quantity should be on the vertical axis? On the horizontal?
    - How will you measure each quantity (and their uncertainties) that you will put on the horizontal and vertical axes?
    - How many data points do you need for a good plot? Why?
    - Carry out your experiment and produce your plot!

**NOTES:** You are required to include a schematic diagram with force vectors as part of your summary. Also, be sure that the hanging mass is NOT swinging as it falls.

## Advanced/Extended Lab Ideas (A-level) (Choose ONE)

- What happens if the cart mass increases but the pulling force is constant?
- How does the force pulling on the cart compare with the weight of the masses hanging off of the side? Use Newton's 2nd Law to explain your observations.
- Propose **and carry out** an experiment on something you are curious about (get your lab instructor's approval first
