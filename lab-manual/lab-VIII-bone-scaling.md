## Conceptual (C-Level) DONE BEFORE LAB

Larger animals, for excellent (physics!) reasons, have proportionally thicker bones than smaller animals. This goal of this lab is to help you understand why that is.

**Answer the questions in D2L/Sapling before lab: look for assignment "Pre-Lab 9"**
 

## Basic Lab (B-Level)

- Time to find a law for bone scaling! Several sizes of bones are available. Measure their length and diameter (don't forget to account for uncertainty).
- We want to investigate how the thickness of the bones changes when the size of the animal changes. What should you plot on the vertical and horizontal axes? Make this plot.
- What fits better, a linear model, or a power model? Compare with the results you expect from C-Level.

## Advanced/Extended Lab (A-Level) (DO ALL BULLET POINTS)

In the C-Level, you found that the bones of animals don't scale in the way you might think, and in the B-Level you found that the thickness of bones scales up more quickly than the length. In the A-Level, you will see how to derive the power law that relates the bone diameter to the bone length.

- If the stress is to stay the same when each dimension doubles, how much should the cross-sectional area of the bones increase by? Write your answer as $A_{new} = q * A_{old}$ , where $q$ is the value you are looking for. HINT: Set the "new" and "old" stress equal to each other, then write the "new" force (weight) in terms of the "old" force, and solve for Anew.
- Using your answer to the previous question, find how much the diameter of the bone increases by. You may find it useful to write the new area $A_{new}$ in terms of the new diameter $D_{new}$, and the old area $A_{old}$ in terms of the old diameter $D_{old}$.
- How much would the diameter need to increase by if, instead of each dimension doubling, each dimension was multiplied by a factor of $n$? Your answer should be an equation containing $D_{new} = ?$, where the $?$ contains $D_{old}$, $n$, and possibly some numbers.
- Using your previous answer, and the fact that $n$ tells you how much the length of the bone changed ($L_{new} = n * L_{old}$), substitute $L_{new}$ and $L_{old}$ in for $n$ to find how $D_{new}$ depends on $D_{old}$, $L_{old}$, and $L_{new}$.
- Compare the power law you just found with your experimental results from B-Level. Do they agree within uncertainties?
