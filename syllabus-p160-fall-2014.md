## Grading

**Components of your grade:**

Homework | Labs | Exam Practice Problems | Exam In-class (3) | Final
:------: | :--: | :--------------------: | :---------------: | :---: 
  20%    | 20%  |     10%                |   30% (10% each)  |  10%

**How you will be graded:**

+ **Homework:** All homework will be online, and due EVERY TUESDAY at 11:55PM. Log in to the course D2L page, navigate to content, then Homework, and you will see the link that takes you to the homework.
+ **Labs:** There are three graded parts to each lab. They are summarized below with full details available in D2L.
    + C-level: (70% of score on a lab) Online pre-lab, due EVERY MONDAY at 8PM, that must be completed online. If you do not complete the quiz you will not be permitted to enter the lab room until you have completed the pre-lab, and attendance at and participation in, the lab.
    + B-level: (20% of score on a lab) One page Word/PDF write-up, due EVERY MONDAY at 8PM in D2L dropbox; only one lab is submitted per group.
    + A-level: (10% of score on a lab) One page summary given to your lab instructor no later than one week after the lab is completed.
    + **You must attend a lab** to get credit for any work related to the lab, including the online C-level pre-lab quiz.
+ **Exams:**
    + There will be three exams during the semester and a final. Dates are on the attached schedule. Each of these exams has equal weight. The final *will be cumulative*.
    + A practice exam problem is due EVERY FRIDAY AT THE BEGINNING OF LECTURE on the problem solving sheets on the course web site. These problems are about the same level of difficulty as the work questions on the exams will be. You will get detailed feedback on your work the Monday after you turn in the problem.

**How letter grades will be assigned:**

| A | B | C | D | F |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  100%-90% | 90%-80% | 80%-70%  | 70%-60% |  <60% |

 + **Pluses and minuses will be used**, with a plus for (roughly) the top quarter of a grade range and minus for (roughly) the bottom quarter of a grade range.

### Disability services

Students with disabilities who believe they may need an accommodation in this class are encouraged to contact Greg Toutges, Director of Disability Services at 477-4318 (Voice) or 1-800-627-3529 (MRS/TTY), Flora Frick 154 as soon as possible to ensure that accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

### Combination of lab sections in online course work

The Desire2Learn instructional management system and Sapling Learning are being used to provide you with content and your grades for both the lecture and lab portion of the course.   Although you have registered in separate lecture and lab sections, there will be a single D2L site for this class, and the entire class, regarding of lab section, is enrolled together in this D2L site.   In addition, every lab and lecture instructor (Matt Craig and Juan Cabanela) and the departmental assistant (Joy Lindell) have access to this D2L site, including the discussion boards and grade entry.
